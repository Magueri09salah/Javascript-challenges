<script> window.onload = ()=>{
    alert('Username not valid please try again !!');
    window.location.href = '/';
}

</script>

<!-- If you want to call a script on the client side and then perform a server-side action like rendering a view with res.render, you can use a combination of client-side code and a subsequent redirect to another route on the server. Here's an example:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    // Send the initial HTML response
    res.send(`
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
        <head> -->
